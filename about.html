<div class="h6">
<p><strong>The Beyond Journal</strong> is a podcast made by Mylea Hildebrand and Madison Posthumus, two university students from Winnipeg, Manitoba.</p>
</div>

<hr color="#30007C">

<p><div class="h4">Mylea Hildebrand</div></p>
<p><div class="h5">Voice of Mylea Smith</div></p>
<p>Mylea is the lead writer, and as you've probably figured out, lead actor. She is a second year actuarial sciences student at the University of Manitoba. Her character is highly based on herself, as she also wakes up at 5:30 and drinks oat milk. Her hobbies include hanging out with her cats, reading, and contemplating existence.</p>
<div class="episode-text">Madison's notes: I don't understand anything about her but I love her anyways</div>

<hr color="#30007C">

<p><div class="h4">Madison Posthumus</div></p>
<p><div class="h5">Various extra voices, and the Sorcerer</div></p>
<p>Madison does everything else- editing, production, distribution, and web design. They are currently a first year creative industries student at X University in Toronto, but hopes to transfer to media production, which makes sense.</p>
<div class="episode-text">Madison's notes: Hi it's me!! I also run this website :)</div>

<hr color="#30007C">

<p><div class="h4">Spencer Stevens</div></p>
<p><div class="h5">Voice of Alex</div></p>
<p>Spencer is a very cool guy who is currently going to circus school, because he's JUST THAT COOL. Fun fact, he's the only cast member that Madison and Mylea met specifically through this podcast!</p>
<div class="episode-text">Madison's notes: Check out his instagram if you can find it, his circus stuff is amazing!!</div>

<hr color="#30007C">

<p><div class="h4">Guoria Sun</div></p>
<p><div class="h5">Voice of Lily</div></p>
<p>Guoria got dragged into this project by her friends Madison and Mylea. She shares many similarities to the character of Lily, including, but not limited to, her weakness for 'pretty' boys. She's a second year forensic sciences student at the University of Toronto and can tell you all about bloodstain patterns.</p>
<div class="episode-text">Madison's notes: Poor Guoria... she didn't sign up for this......</div>

<hr color="#30007C">

<p><div class="h4">Cameron Posthumus</div></p>
<p><div class="h5">Voice of the Watcher</div></p>
<p>Cameron is Madison's younger brother, and thus is a very convenient actor to say a few ominous words here and there. His interests include fashion, indie jazz, and internet lore, and he is probably the coolest freshman you'll ever meet.</p>
<div class="episode-text">Madison's notes: 9/10 Cool Dude. (the missing 1 point is because he's taller than me)</div>

<hr color="#30007C">

<p><div class="h4">Rowan Hildebrand</div></p>
<p><div class="h5">Voice of various S.A. Communications employees, and Reginald</div></p>
<p>Mylea's younger brother. I'm going to get him to write his own blurb because I don't know much about him.</p>
<div class="episode-text">Madison's notes: once he chased Guoria with a foam axe. I'm not entirely sure if she knew it was foam...</div>

<hr color="#30007C">

<p><div class="h4">Madison Wu</div></p>
<p><div class="h5">Voiceovers</div></p>
<p>Our friend from school! She did a voiceover for a school project so we had to get her on the team.</p>
<div class="episode-text">Madison (Posthumus)'s notes: Madisons unite!!</div>
