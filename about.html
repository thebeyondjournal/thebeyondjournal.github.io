<p>Mylea is the lead writer, and as you've probably figured out, lead actor. She is a first year university student at the University of Manitoba. Her hobbies include hanging out with her cats, reading, and contemplating existence.</p>

<p>Hi I made this website because I'm too cheap to hire someone who actually knows how web design works. I'm the one who teaches myself things like soundscaping and website design in a hurried panic because running a podcast takes a lot more work than I initially thought. I was SUPPOSED to help Mylea write, but I ended up pushing all the work onto her to focus on producing and other technical stuff. I'm... undeclared, because I have no idea what to do with my life.</p>
