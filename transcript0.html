<p>Here, like this. You can just speak into it, talk about your day, rant about anything that might be troubling you… I know you don’t always feel comfortable telling me everything, but it’s good to get your thoughts out.</p>

<div class="t-h">MYLEA</div>
<p>And how often am I supposed to do this?</p>

<div class="t-h">DR. HERNANDEZ</div>
<p>As often as you feel like it. The goal is to work up to daily entries, but new habits take time, so to start, just do it when you want.</p>

<div class="t-h">MYLEA</div>
<p>Are you going to be checking this?</p>

<div class="t-h">DR. HERNANDEZ</div>
<p>I would like to make sure you’re doing it, yes. It’s important to express your thoughts, and this is a very good way to work on that. But I won’t listen to any of them. I want you to feel free to say whatever you’d like.</p>

<div class="t-h">MYLEA</div>
<p>...</p>

<div class="t-h">DR. HERNANDEZ</div>
<p>I would like you to make at least one entry. You won’t know if it’s helpful or not until you try it.

<div class="t-h">MYLEA</div>
<p>Fine. Now can you stop recording this?</p>

<div class="t-h">DR. HERNANDEZ</div>
