<p>Dear Journal, today was&hellip; god this so pointless. Really, Dr. Hernandez, 
this is supposed to help me become less anxious and negative by giving me another 
stupid task to add to my mile long to-do list. Like, it&rsquo;s been a week, do I 
feel less stressed out, no, more positive, no how about happier, well like always 
that&rsquo;s a big no. I just feel the same. I know, I know I just need to try more 
and be not as dismissive of things. Which definitely goes against my default 
settings but whatever, might as well try and be positive, I got nothing else going 
for me. (Sigh), let&rsquo;s start over.</p>

<p>Dear journal, today was pretty normal, I got up at five, stared at the ceiling 
for half an hour, went for a jog at 6, showered, had my normal smoothie and toast 
breakfast, then I read for a bit, did some studying and got ready. I was in one of 
those brief moments where I thought I looked cute so of course I had to wear my new 
short skirt and top that I bought in a previous moment where I possessed self-esteem. Then I took the bus at 7:35 and by 7:45 I had come to the realization that I wasn&rsquo;t comfortable in the outfit I was in, nor was I as attractive as the size 2 mannequin that was sporting this outfit when I walked into the store, so of course my next move was staring out the window trying not to cry in a public place. So, again, pretty normal day.</p>
<p>Anyways, I got to the university at 8:15. I had Stats at 8:30 then Economics at 
9:30 and the lab for my easy math class at 11:30. Maddie&rsquo;s first class was at 
11:30 but they came a bit early to bombard me with interesting things they learned 
in history and new drawings they were working on. How people like them could wake 
up at 10, roll out of bed, get dressed, eat something quick then be ready for the 
world by 10:30 always astounded me. I went to my Lab and of course the first words 
out of Mack Johnson&rsquo;s mouth, was some insulting or objectifying comment about 
my rarely framed body. How his two brain cells managed to get the prerequisite math 
grade required for this course is a mystery. Then I took the bus back home, and 
spent the rest of time up to this point studying. So yeah, nothing out of the 
ordinary today, well except &hellip;</p>

<p>I probably imagined it, but I swear that I saw the same person outside the bus 
window on my ride to and from the university. Yeah, he was standing in front of the 
old church on *insert street name* We were stopped at the lights there for a little 
while, and he was there the entire time, there&rsquo;s no bus stop there and 
it&rsquo;s Wednesday there&rsquo;s no church.</p>

<p>[A FAINT SCRAPING AGAINST A COUNTERTOP]</p>

<p>The really weird thing is I don&rsquo;t think he moved, like not even an inch, 
all he did was smile, he looked almost unnatural, like I&rsquo;m talking uncanny 
valley, here.</p>

<p>[LIQUID BEING POURED]</p>

<p>But like I said I probably just imagined it and&nbsp; I mean I was looking 
through the bus window, even if there was someone there, they were distorted 
because of the lens. That&rsquo;s a thing, right, yeah definitely.&nbsp;</p>

<p>[THE CLINK OF A CUP BEING SET DOWN ON A COUNTER]</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m gonna get more tea. What? I swear my mug was empty, well I can&rsquo;t
 believe I&rsquo;m saying this, I think my therapist is right, I&rsquo;m working 
myself too hard, that&rsquo;s it, all of whatever I think is happening is just a 
response to me being over-taxed. That seems right. Ok I&rsquo;m going to eat dinner 
then chill until I fall asleep, one night of not being ultra-productive, will do me 
some good. Ok well, goodbye journal?, I got to think of a sendoff for this, this 
Mylea Smith signing off from- no, no, and why did I automatically do a male 
announcer voice, nope not doing this tonight.</p>
